                    <h3>Technical Description</h3>
                        <p>The team.html file is a webpage designed to showcase the team members involved in the "Life on Land" project. Built using HTML and CSS, the page features a responsive layout with interactive elements to enhance user engagement. The team members are displayed in a grid-like structure using flexbox, ensuring the layout adapts seamlessly to different screen sizes. Each team member is represented by a card containing their image, name, role, and social media links (GitHub, LinkedIn, and email). The page includes dynamic hover effects, where hovering over a team member's image reduces its opacity and reveals a description with a smooth transition, including a scaling and rotating animation. The design incorporates a vibrant linear gradient background and interactive social media icons that scale up on hover. The footer provides copyright information and links to individual student editor and validation pages. Overall, the page combines clean, modern design with interactive features, making it both visually appealing and functional for showcasing the team.</p>
